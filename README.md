# Multiple Agent Framework

Multi-agent conversational frameworks for LLMs where multiple AI agents can converse with each other to adapt and collaborate to achieve an objective. In the case of my code, it had one agent for prompting and feedback and the other as a coder. 

I was playing around with Microsoft's autogen creating different python scripts.
